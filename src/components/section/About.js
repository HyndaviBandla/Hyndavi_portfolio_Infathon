        <h2>Hyndavi Bandla</h2>
        <p>
          Good morning, Iâ€™m Bandla Hyndavi. I have completed my schooling and
          secondary education in my native place.I am currently pursing my
          second year of B-Tech with major's in computer science engineering at
          VIT-Ap University.I had a very good industrial experience by
          completing my 2 month internship in DRDO Hyderabad as project intern
          where I became capable of working as individual and improved my
          problem solving skills and generated radar data using python which is
          useful for defence. Participating actively in extracurricular
          activities and serving as a core team member of clubs like the
          Computer Society of India (CSI) and GeeksforGeeks (GFG) at my
          university has significantly enhanced my confidence, communication,
          and time management skills. In free time I used to spend time with
          friends and family, doing physical exercises and Meditation. I have
          dynamic character and will have a positive impact on my surroundings,I
          aim to break the barriers,inspire and pave the way for myself to
          thrive in the dynamic world of technology.
